```

## Part A: Make edits (no conflict)

```{r partner_1a}
# Partner 1: 
# Run the code below to see the original graph
# Change the code below to make the point color change based on 'cut', and update the theme to theme_bw(). Update the title to include your first name. 

ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_void() +
  labs(title = "Joe")
```

```{r partner_2a}
# Partner 2: 
# Run the code below to see the original graph
# Change the code below to make the geom a geom_jitter, and update the theme to theme_light. Update the title to include your first name. 

ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x = color, y = carat)+
  geom_jitter()+
  theme_dark()+
  labs(title = "Allison was here")
```

## PART B: Make problems

```{r break-it-1}
x <- 567
y <- 123
abc <-  x/2 +3*y

di <- diamonds %>% 
  filter(carat, color)

```

```{r break-it-2}
#random code
ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x = color))+
  geom_histogram(bins = 20)
```
